According to the latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global average temperature rise could reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years. Thatâ€™s 10 years sooner than expected. This unprecedented extreme weather change and scarcity of resources impact mass cultivation farmers. We offer customized monitoring information and automation solutions through trending digital technologies to optimize our customers' harvest and productively utilize their resources..",
